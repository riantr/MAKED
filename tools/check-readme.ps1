# Check the claims in README.md against the tree.
#
#   .\tools\check-readme.ps1
#
# A document that states a number is a claim about the tree, and a claim
# that is not checked is a claim that rots. This README carried 389 backend
# tests, 112 frontend tests, 320 integration checks, 120 backend mutations,
# 44 frontend mutations and 180 anchors -- every one of them stale, and
# every one of them wrong in the same direction. A reader who checks the
# tree against the document finds the document wrong, and a project whose
# document is wrong is a project whose numbers cannot be used.
#
# So the check is an invariant, not a snapshot: **what the document states
# IS what the tree has**. The expected value is read from the document
# under audit; the actual value is derived from the tree; the two are
# compared. Adding a test then requires updating the document, and
# forgetting to is a red gate rather than a quiet lie.
#
# There are three kinds of claim here now, and each is checked in the way
# that fits it:
#
# The NUMBERS -- the test, mutation, anchor and gate counts -- are read out
# of the document and compared with counts derived from the tree.
#
# The LISTING -- the project structure -- has to name every source file, and
# a name has to appear as many times as the tree has files with that name.
#
# The VARIABLES -- the environment variables the server reads, and the
# defaults they have -- are derived from the code and compared with the
# table the document states, because that table is the first thing a reader
# copies from.
#
# It reads only. It never writes to the source tree, so it is safe to run
# at any time -- including while a mutation suite is running, though the
# answer is then only true between mutations.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  every claim in the document matches the tree
#   1  a claim in the document does not match the tree
#
# The integration-check count is deliberately NOT derived here. It is the
# number of checks the integration suite actually ran, and some of its
# assertions sit in loops, so it cannot be derived from the script's text.
# The suite checks it against the document itself, at the end of a run,
# where it knows the count -- see the tail of tools/integration-test.ps1.
